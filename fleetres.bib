America is leading again on the world stage. We are not hiding from the challenges we face. We are confronting them head-on and pursuing opportunities to promote the securii and prosperii of all Americans. e United States faces an extraordinarily dangerous world, fi lled with a wide range of threats that have intensified in recent years. When I came into office, rogue regimes were developing nuclear weapons and missiles to threaten the entire planet. Radical Islamist terror groups were fl ourishing. Terrorists had taken control of vast swaths of the Middle East. Rival powers were aggressively undermining American interests around the globe. At home, porous borders and unenforced immigration laws had created a host of vulnerabilities. Criminal cartels were bringing drugs and danger into our communities. Unfair trade practices had weakened our economy and exported our jobs overseas. Unfair burden-sharing with our allies and inadequate investment in our own defense had invited danger from those who wish us harm. Too many Americans had lost trust in our government, faith in our future, and confidence in our values. Nearly one year later, although serious challenges remain, we are charting a new and very dii erent course.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework to systematically measure and assess power grids' resilience with a focus on performance as perceived by customers at the power distribution level. The proposed framework considers an analogous measure of availability as a basic metric for resilience and defines other key resilience-related concepts and metrics, such as resistance and brittleness. This framework also provides a measurement for the degree of functional dependency of loads on power grids and demonstrates how the concepts of resilience and dependency are inherently related. It also discusses the implications of considering human-centered processes as fundamental constituting components of infrastructure systems. Thanks to its quantitative nature, the proposed resilience framework enables the creation of tools to evaluate power grids' performance as a lifeline and to assess the effects of plans for optimal electrical power infrastructure deployment and operation. The discussion is supported by practical examples and empirical records from field damage assessments conducted after recent notable natural disasters.},

abstract = {The current resilience literature lacks a thorough comparison of the behavior of resilience metrics using fundamental models of system performance. To close this gap, this study identifies three metrics that either encompass or can be easily amended to encompass resilience definition of resilience as proposed by Ayyub [1]. The three selected metrics are integral resilience [1], [2], quotient resilience [3], [4], and expected system degradation function [5]. While each of these metrics measures resilience in its own way, gaps exist that affect the metrics' decision-support potential. This study identifies gaps common to these metrics, which limit their decision support value. The gaps include: (1) Lack of consideration of stakeholder performance preferences. (2) Lack of consideration of different stakeholder time horizon. (3) Lack of performance substitution over time. The first step of the study is to modify the three selected metrics to satisfy the broad definition of resilience if necessary. The second step is to develop extended versions of the metric to close the three identified gaps. The third step is to compare the six metrics using a fundamental model of performance and need with known variables (failure time, robustness, recovery time, recovery performance level, etc.). The extended metrics demonstrate different values from the original metrics which are consistent with the spirit of the metrics and largely congruent with intuition.},

@article{Carpenter2001,
abstract = {Resilience is the magnitude of disturbance that can be tolerated before a socioecological system (SES) moves to a different region of state space controlled by a different set of processes. Resilience has multiple levels of meaning: as a metaphor related to sustainability, as a property of dynamic models, and as a measurable quantity that can be assessed in field studies of SES. The operational indicators of resilience have, however, received little attention in the literature. To assess a system's resilience, one must specify which system configuration and which disturbances are of interest. This paper compares resilience properties in two contrasting SES, lake districts and rangelands, with respect to the following three general features: (a) The ability of an SES to stay in the domain of attraction is related to slowly changing variables, or slowly changing disturbance regimes, which control the boundaries of the domain of attraction or the frequency of events that could push the system across the boundaries. Examples are soil phosphorus content in lake districts woody vegetation cover in rangelands, and property rights systems that affect land use in both lake districts and rangelands. (b) The ability of an SES to self-organize is related to the extent to which reorganization is endogenous rather than forced by external drivers. Self-organization is enhanced by coevolved ecosystem components and the presence of social networks that facilitate innovative problem solving. (c) The adaptive capacity of an SES is related to the existence of mechanisms for the evolution of novelty or learning. Examples include biodiversity at multiple scales and the existence of institutions that facilitate experimentation, discovery, and innovation.},

Storms and floods accounted for up to 70{\%} of the 302 natural disasters worldwide, with earthquakes producing the greatest number of fatalities. Man- aging these risks rationally requires an appropriate definition of resilience and associated metrics. This paper provides a resilience definition that meets a set of requirements with clear relationships to reliability and risk as key relevant metrics. The resilience definition proposed is of the intension type, which is of the highest order. Resilience metrics are reviewed, and simplified ones are proposed to meet logically con- sistent requirements drawn from measure theory. Such metrics provide a sound basis for the development of effective decision-making tools for multihazard environments. The paper also examines recovery, with its classifications based on level, spatial, and temporal considerations. Three case studies are developed and used to gain insights to help define recovery profiles. Two recovery profiles, linear and step functions, are introduced. Computational examples and parametric analysis illustrate the reasonableness of the metrics proposed.},

Storms and floods accounted for up to 70{\%} of the 302 natural disasters worldwide in 2011, with earthquakes producing the greatest number of fatalities. Average annual losses in the United States amount to about {\$}55 billion. Enhancing community and system resilience could lead to massive savings through risk reduction and expeditious recovery. The rational management of such reduction and recovery is facilitated by an appropriate definition of resilience and associated metrics. In this article, a resilience definition is provided that meets a set of requirements with clear relationships to the metrics of the relevant abstract notions of reliability and risk. Those metrics also meet logically consistent requirements drawn from measure theory, and provide a sound basis for the development of effective decision-making tools for multihazard environments. Improving the resiliency of a system to meet target levels requires the examination of system enhancement alternatives in economic terms, within a decision-making framework. Relevant decision analysis methods would typically require the examination of resilience based on its valuation by society at large. The article provides methods for valuation and benefit-cost analysis based on concepts from risk analysis and management.},
